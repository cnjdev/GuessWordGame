This is a Hangman-style game with the theme of NES games.  The list is mostly based on the games included in the NES Classic Edition retro console.

To guess a letter, either click the letter in the Available Letters section or press the corresponding key on the keyboard.

You have 8 guesses to guess the title of an NES game.  A sound is played when you win or lose the game and it keeps track of the win-loss record during your current session (until leaving or reloading the page).  
Some basic information on the NES game is given in the Item Information section after the Hangman game is over. An NES-style font is also used throughout the game.  

The game is playable on desktop and mobile.
